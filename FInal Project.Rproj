## Project Summary


This is meant to compare the increase in Johnson & Johnson's earnings to inflation, to see whether the company is still making as much profit relative to the value of money as they used to.
This is the raw data of Johnson & Johnson's quarterly earnings per share, and it doesn't seem quite legible.
```{r JohnsonJohnsonnumbers}
summary(JohnsonJohnson)
```



At the moment the above numbers are, well, numbers. A plot that can more easily convey the information has been put below.

## Johnson&Johnson Quarterly Earnings per Share

```{r JohnsonJohnson, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
plot(JohnsonJohnson)
```
As you can see, the earnings per share of Johnson & Johnson have gone up dramatically over time. However, inflation should also be taken into consideration. If you didn't know, inflation is when, over time, money becomes worth less than it was before. When the inflation percent is high, that mean money has become less valuable, and when its low, a currency has become more valuable. Inflation is compounded annually. If the US Dollar inflated 3% from 1960-1961, then $1 in 1960 is worth $1.03 in 1961.

As the graph above shows, the average annual inflation rate is about 3%. This means that the amount needed to buy things will, on average, increase by more each year. This also means that company earnings need to match that increase to remain as profitable as they were before. With the average inflation of 3.22%, the 1960 Earning/Share of about $0.50 should translate to about $0.61 in 1980. However, the earning growth of Johnson and Johnson outpaced the inflation, and reached $16.20 in 1980. This shows that Johnson and Johnson earnings outpaced inflation about 27 times over, which would make it immensely profitable during that time.
